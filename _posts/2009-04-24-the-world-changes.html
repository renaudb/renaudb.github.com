<p>Have you ever been obsessed by a question? One of these existential interrogation that continuously stays in your head and that you can't get rid of without answering it? Well last week, I had such an interrogation. For the whole week I kept wondering what would happens if a T. Rex fell. With its short arms, it would probably hurt itself badly, wouldn't it? Well, after watching the whole Jurrasic Park trilogy, I realized that my interrogation was totally pointless. Why? Because there is a larger dinosaur than the T. Rex called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinosaurus">Spinosaurus</a>. This new information totally changed my world.</p>

<p>Talking about changes, you probably noticed that I changed the design of my website. I wasn't happy with the color scheme anymore so I changed to something lighter. Again, I am not a photoshop pro so I kept it simple with a minimalist look. It should also be easier to browse. The rest of the website should follow soon. I am still working on bits of the wordpress template, but as soon as I am happy with the result, I will start working on the other parts of the website.</p>

<p>On another note, I finished my first year at the university of Waterloo. I am going back home tomorrow for my first work term. I will work as a software developer for <a href="http://a2m.com/">Artificial Mind and Movement</a>, an independent video game studio in downtown Montreal. It should be great. I will be part of the Wii/PS2 engine team, so I should do more technical work than what I am used to. I hope I will learn a lot. It also means a change of language. I will get to practice my C++ a bit more. As I like to think: there is nothing like practical work to learn a new language. I hope I am not wrong...</p>
