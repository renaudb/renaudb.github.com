<p>I know I said yesterday that I wouldn't work on anything for a while but today I got bored of calculus so I ended up writing a little RSS hack. <a href="http://www.musiqueplus.com/mnet/">M. Net</a> (short for Monsieur Net) is a tech show airing on the french channel <a href="http://www.musiqueplus.com/">Musique Plus</a> that I used to watch a lot when I was younger and that I still listen to when I can. The problem is: since I moved to Waterloo, I can't watch it anymore because we don't have any french channel with our TV package. Musique Plus offers some shows online, but they are all in flash and aggregated by a bad RSS feed that is not compatible with <a href="http://www.getmiro.com/">Miro</a>. After looking a bit at the source code of the video page, I figured out how and where to get the videos from so I decided to build my own video RSS that would be compatible with both <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/">iTunes</a> and Miro. I also fetch more informations on the shows and the files using different scripts. The whole thing is written in PHP with a cron job to update the file on a regular basis. You can access this feed here: <a href="http://renaudbourassa.com/random/mnet/mnet.rss">http://renaudbourassa.com/random/mnet/mnet.rss</a>.</p>

<p>Now back to calculus.</p>
