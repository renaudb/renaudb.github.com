<p>Today the new version of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, version 2.7, came out and I decided to give it a try. You probably won't notice anything different since the frontend is the same but there may be some bugs due to the backend update. If you see anything, just let me know. I have to say that this version's administration panel is a big improvement over the previous one. It is way more concise and clear than before, making the content management easier.</p>

<p>With the exam session going on right now followed by the Christmas holidays, it doesn't leave me a lot of time to work on projects so everything will probably be on hold until the start of the next term. However, while surfing on the internet I stumbled on this <a href="http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/">cool project</a> and it gave me some ideas for a new project so stay tuned!</p>
