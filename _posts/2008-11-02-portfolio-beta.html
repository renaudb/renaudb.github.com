<p>With the end of the midterm rush I got more time to work on non-school stuff so I decided to work on my <a href="http://portfolio.rhinosphere.com/">portfolio</a>. I just released a beta version of it which I'm pretty happy with. It is a mix of PHP and javascript. PHP to retrieve the information on the different projects and javascript to display it with some eye candy. I used <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for all the animations. On the design side, I wanted something that integrated well with this blog and I thing I succeeded quite well at that. I could write more about it but I think the best way to judge it is to go and take a look so here is the link: <a href="http://portfolio.rhinosphere.com/">http://portfolio.rhinosphere.com/</a>.</p>

<p>I also wrote a directory view script to display the files of projects that are not web projects. It uses PHP to retrieve the file list and a jQuery script I wrote to reorder the files without reloading the whole page every time. It also more visually appealing than the classic Apache directory view.</p>
