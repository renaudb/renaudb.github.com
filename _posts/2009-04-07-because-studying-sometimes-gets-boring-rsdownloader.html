<p>Because studying sometimes gets boring, I often end up working on something else during the exam sessions. This time, I got frustrated with <a href="http://rapidshare.com">RapidShare</a> and its annoying wait times. Don't misunterstand me, I think RapidShare is a really useful website. Even if they keep the download speed of free user down, it is still faster than setting a torrent when it comes to send a large file to someone else. The problem is that with all the waiting times, I often start a download session, then go work on something else and end up forgetting about my download. When I get back to RapidShare, my session has expired and I have to start over. This is especially annoying when trying to download multiple files since the wait time between two download is approximately 15 minutes.</p>

<p>My solution: RSDownloader. It is a small ruby script I wrote to easily download any number of files from RapidShare. The script graps all the wait times directly from the site, thus optimizing your time. It starts the downloads (approximately) as soon as the countdowns reach 0. It uses wget to get the files so it is for Linux and motivated MacOSX users only. You can get the script from my <a href="http://github.com/RenaudB/rsdownloader/tree/master">github</a> or here.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Since I keep making change to the source code, I decided to take it off this post. The latest "stable" version should always be available on my github.</p>
