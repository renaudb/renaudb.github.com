<p>I just finished uploading my <a href="http://renaudbourassa.com/blog/project-euler-solutions/">solutions</a> to the <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problems 26 to 30. They are all in Ruby since it is the language I am currently learning during my free time. I decided this time not to write the answers at the end. This way you have to execute the code yourself if you just want the answer. I also included comments to explain the parts that are harder to understand. If you have any question regarding any of the solutions, just post it as a comment.</p>
