<p>It has been nearly a year since I wrote my last post while travelling to Istanbul. It thus seems like an appropriate time to refresh this blog with some sort of update about what I have been up to.</p>

<p>After a stop in Manhattan over the summer where I interned at Bloomberg, I am now in Redmond, WA working for the tech giant that is Microsoft. Spending the summer living in the West Village, at the heart of New York City, has been an incredible experience. It is a beautiful city that never ceases to surprise you with new things to do. Getting the opportunity to work at Bloomberg on risk analysis was also an interesting experience.</p>

<p>However, after four months in a forest of glass and concrete, Redmond and its giant trees already feels like a nice break. There I have joined the Xbox team, with which I will be spending the next four months. My goal for this internship is to try something different and gain as much knowledge about the field as possible. I don't know much about the specifics of the project I will be working on, but I already received my Xbox gear to practice in the meantime.</p>
