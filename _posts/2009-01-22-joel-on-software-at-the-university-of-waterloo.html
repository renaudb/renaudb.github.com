<p>Today I assisted to a talk by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky">Joel Spolsky</a>, know for his blog <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a>. I have read a bit on him before while reading <a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/">Founders at Work</a>, but it is the first time that I see one of his talks and I have to say that he is a pretty good speaker. Not only is he interesting but he is also very entertaining. The talk was hosted by the University's <a href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/">Computer Science Club</a> and was entitled Computer Science and the Software Industry.</p>

<p>He talked about his experience as a student and as a software designer. I like his pragmatic way of thinking in which the code, or in other words, the actual product, is central to the software development process. He insisted on the fact that most big companies only care about the product being shipped and not the product being good. He also talked a bit about the QA process and the adoption, for the worst, of automatic processes to manage this part of the software development cycle citing Windows Vista as an example. He underlined some of the the dualities between the UNIX and the Windows way of programming as well as the West Coast and the East Coast way of managing and their effects on software quality. Finally, he talked about the importance of having good writing and communication skills to be able to share and be recognized for the work that you do. Something I can only agree with.</p>

<p>Overall it was a really interesting talk and if you have the chance to see him, don't miss it, because it is totally worth it.</p>
