<p>After what is my shortest Christmas Holiday for the last three years, I am back in <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca">Waterloo</a>. During these two weeks, I took a break from everything I was working on and spent most of my time with my friends and family. The little spare time I got went into <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problems. I managed to solve the first 25 using C and will probably post my code in the days to come.</p>

<p>I also received my marks for my first term and I have to say that I am pretty happy with what I got. This term is more focused on computer science related subjects with courses such as <em>Functional Programming and Data Abstraction</em> (using Scheme and C++) and <em>Dig</em><em>ital Circuits and Systems</em>. I also have two economy classes which is something I enjoy a lot. It is also the beginning of the hiring process for this summer co-op term.</p>

<p>And, as of right now, I am reading books on ruby and ruby on rails to improve my skills. I did a lot of small scripts and projects using this language/framework, but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC</a> concept is still new to me. I am now looking at creating a complete, usable web application so I need to expand my knowledge a bit more. Stay tuned for more.</p>
