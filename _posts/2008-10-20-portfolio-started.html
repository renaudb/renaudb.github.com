<p>I started working on my portfolio during the weekend. The frontend is practicly done. I use <a href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a> a lot for different animations and since it is the first time I use this library extensively it takes me more time than usual to code the frontend but I'm really happy with the current result. As of now I don't have a demo version but I will release one as soon as I have time to finish the scripts and correct the bugs. This will probably be next week or so since all the midterm exams and projects are taking a lot of my time right now.</p>
