<p>Last Friday, Yahoo! was back at the University of Waterloo for <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/hacku/">Hack U 2009</a>. After a week of talks by web gurus, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf">Rasmus Lerdorf</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Douglas Crockford</a>, came the 24 hours hack event. This year, we decided to do something useful and in this tough economic time, we ended up creating a mashup to follow job trends across the United States. We scraped all the data we could from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, making it possible to search for statistics and open positions relevant to a certain type of job. We then display the result on a map using different metrics such as the average salary or the number of workers.</p>

<p>The result is called JobU and can be found here: <a href="http://renaudbourassa.com/projects/jobu/">http://renaudbourassa.com/projects/jobu/</a>.</p>

<p>We won 4th place (when really, we should have won at least 3rd). The first place went to <a href="http://docuvine.joygarage.com/">Docuvine</a>, a really interesting web application that mimics Google Wave. Here are some picture of the event.</p>
