<p>It is finally up. I have been working on the script for the <a href="http://contact.rhinosphere.com">contact form</a> during the weekend. It uses AJAX and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> to send emails without reloading the page and to add some cool effects. I haven't had time to test it thoroughly so it may contain some bugs. If you notice anything wrong, don't hesitate to post it here.</p>
