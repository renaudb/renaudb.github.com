<p>I updated <a href="http://globami.rhinosphere.com">Globami</a> during the weekend. The most notable change is the new interface which is more minimalist and put the emphasis on the map and the search bar. I also optimized the code for networks other than twitter by changing the format of the JSON string generated by the php backend and by looking for the coordinate of friends on the php backend instead of the AJAX frontend. Another notable change is the addition of <a href="http://www.pownce.com">Pownce</a> as one of the supported networks.</p>

<p>So, go take a look and stay tuned for more updates. Next step, fixing and extending the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/searchmonkey/">SearchMonkey </a>application as well as a more informations box for each friend using JQuery.</p>
