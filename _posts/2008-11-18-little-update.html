<p>I haven't posted for a while so here is a little update on what is going on with me. I'm still troubleshooting my <a href="http://portfolio.rhinosphere.com/">portfolio</a>, searching for bugs and correcting them. There was some problem with the CSS on certain browsers, especially IE. University is taking most of my time. The assignments get longer and harder so I have less free time to do extra work. The Lego Robot Project of my Software Engineering 101 is due for next week so I'm spending more time in the lab.</p>

<p>Also, last thursday was the Engineering Student Awards Dinner. As an entrance scolarship recipient I was invited with some 400 other engineering students. At my table was sitting Gaurav Jain, who graduated from software engineering last year and is now the VP of <a href="http://www.polarmobile.com/">Polar Mobile</a>, a young and quite successful company developing a smartphone publishing tool. I had the occasion to talk a bit with him about how he started the company and how he is managing it. He is a pretty brilliant guy and his company looks really promising.</p>

<p>I'm not working on a particular project. I discovered <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> and spent some time doing the first 10 challenges in C. I'm currently learning Ruby and the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a> framework via tutorials. I have an idea in mind for a future project that would fit perfectly with Rails but I'm not proficient enough right now to do anything effective. But I'm a quick learner so stay tuned!</p>
