<p>Today was The Day for our <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/">Software Engineering 101</a> robot. After more than two months of programming, our robot has finally been put to the test. The goal of this project was to program a robot that tracks a green line and turns when it hits squares of a certain color. I was the leader of a team of 9 peoples called team Nerdcore. We did pretty good, ending with the best time average. However, our robot having been benchmarked as one of the fastest had a big time modification factor so we ended up finishing sixth out of thirteen which is still pretty good. Here are the videos of our two forward runs.</p>

<p>We also wrote a backward program for extra points. We are one of the only team who got it to work. Here is the video of it.</p>

<p>So this is it for this project. The only thing remaining is adding the final touches to the final report and send it. If we can do as good with the final report as we did with the preliminary design report, this project would be nearly perfect. Well done Team Nerdcore!</p>
