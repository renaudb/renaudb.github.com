<p>It has been more than eight months since my last post. Far from doing nothing, I just couldn't find anything to write about. This post is an attempt to break this silence by sharing some of what happened during that period.</p>

<p>After yet another round of interviews, I decided to comeback to the East Coast for the summer. This follows two internships in the Bay Area after which I thought it would be interesting to try something different. So I accepted an offer at Bloomberg, in the middle of New York City. This would give me a unique opportunity to experience the city so nice, they named it twice. And I loved it.</p>
