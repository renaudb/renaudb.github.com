<p>I added a new feature to <a href="http://globami.rhinosphere.com">Globami</a>. This will probably be one of the final updates since I don't think of anything else to add. So this new feature is called the "more" option. It gives more informations about a certain friend when you click on the "more" link at the bottom right of his info bubble. It then launch a <a href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a> dialog with more complete informations on the person. This is my first try at JQuery so it is a pretty simple script.</p>

<p>Also, I have no plan to add any other networks now. If you have a request for a specific network, just post it here and I will see what I can do.</p>
