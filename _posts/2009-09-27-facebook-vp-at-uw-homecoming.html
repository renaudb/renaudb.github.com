<p>Yesterday was Homecoming at the University of Waterloo. For the occasion, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?execbios">Chamath Palihapitiya</a>, Vice President of User Growth, Mobile and International Expansion at Facebook and University of Waterloo '99 alumnus was invited to give a talk entitled "Pushing The Digital Envelope". I filmed most of the talk so I thought I could share it with you. However, the last minutes of the question session are missing since I ran out of space on my Flip Cam near the end.</p>

<p>And also, the Warriors defeated the Windsor Lancers 49-0. Let's go Warriors!</p>
